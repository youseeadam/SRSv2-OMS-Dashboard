<p>
  The problem with their import and steps is that some of the CF fields that are used are very ofthen blank, or just not worhthwhile. So I don't use them, these fields are
  <ul>
    <li>SRSEventDescription_CF</li>
    <li>SRSAlias_CF</li>
    <li>SRSDisplaName_CF</li>
    <li>SRSIPv6Address_CF </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
